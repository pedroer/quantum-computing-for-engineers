This repository contains the source code and supporting materials for the book:

## Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning for Engineers and Developers: Applications of Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning in Engineering Fields
### by Jesse Van Griensven Th√©, Roydon Fraser, and Jos√© Rosas
#### Published by ¬© Springer, 2025

The code examples in this repository are designed to accompany the concepts and applications presented throughout the book. They aim to provide hands-on experience with quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning models, and their engineering applications using frameworks such as Qiskit, PennyLane, and other quantum computing toolkits.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or practicing engineer, this repository will help you:

Explore fundamental and advanced quantum computing techniques.

Implement quantum algorithms tailored to real-world engineering problems.

Apply quantum machine learning methods to practical use cases.

‚öôÔ∏è Codespaces-Ready

The code is organized to support a seamless developer experience with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). You can quickly spin up a development environment directly in your browser using your own GitHub account‚Äîno local setup required. This makes it easy to explore, modify, and test quantum computing examples in a fully containerized environment with all necessary dependencies pre-configured, just click on the green CODE button, codespaces - create. This should initialize the codespaces with the repository code after some minutes and will allow you to click/open the jupyterLab notebooks and run them with a pre-setup environment.

If you decide you want to run it locally on your own machine, please refer to the [Extras.md](Extras.md) file.

üìö For detailed explanations and theoretical context, please refer to the corresponding chapters in the book.
